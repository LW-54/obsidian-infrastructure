## Developer Perspective
The story is highly actionable. The implementation strategy using `eval` to expose metadata as variables is clearly defined, and the field validation loop logic using `jq` aligns with the established patterns from Story 1.3. A developer agent should be able to implement this with minimal ambiguity.

**Final Assessment: READY**
