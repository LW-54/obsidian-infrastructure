# Story Validation Report: Story 1.3

## Quick Summary
- **Story Readiness:** READY
- **Clarity Score:** 9/10
- **Major Gaps:** None.

## Validation Table

| Category | Status | Issues |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity | PASS | Clear purpose: iterate and parse type. |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS | Specific `sed` vs `jq` strategy defined. |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness | PASS | Architecture referenced for JSON extraction. |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment | PASS | Constraints on YAML parsing are explicit. |
| 5. Testing Guidance | PASS | Uses previous story's generator for validation. |

## Specific Issues
- None. The strategy to use `sed` to approximate JSON for `jq` is a bit "hacky" but necessary given the constraints (no `yq`). It is well-explained.

## Developer Perspective
- As a Developer, I understand the goal. I need to be careful with the `sed` regex for YAML-to-JSON conversion to ensure it handles quoted values correctly, but the task is clear.

**Final Assessment:**
- **READY**: The story provides sufficient context for implementation.
